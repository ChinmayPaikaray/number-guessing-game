## 🧠 How It Works

1. The program generates a random number between 1 and 100.
2. The user is prompted to guess the number.
3. After each guess, the program gives feedback:
   - “Too high”
   - “Too low”
   - “Correct!”
4. The number of attempts is limited (e.g., 5 attempts).
5. The player can choose to play multiple rounds.
6. The score is calculated based on how quickly the user guesses the number.
